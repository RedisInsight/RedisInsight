# this dockerfile has two stages, a build stage and the executable stage.
# the build stage is responsible for building the frontend, the backend,
# and the frontend's static assets. ideally, we could build the frontend and backend
# independently and in parallel in different stages, but there is a dependency
# on the backend to build those assets. until we fix that, this approach is
# the best way to minimize the number of node_module restores and build steps
# while still keeping the final image small.

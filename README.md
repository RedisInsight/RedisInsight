* Interactive tutorials to learn easily, among other things, how to leverage the native JSON data structure supporting structured querying and full-text search, including vector similarity search for your AI use cases
* Contextualised recommendations to optimize performance and memory usage. The list of recommendations gets updated as you interact with your database
* Profiler - analyze every command sent to Redis in real-time
* SlowLog - analyze slow operations in Redis instances based on the [Slowlog](https://github.com/RedisInsight/RedisInsight/releases#:~:text=results%20of%20the-,Slowlog,-command%20to%20analyze) command
* Pub/Sub - support for [Redis pub/sub](https://redis.io/docs/manual/pubsub/), enabling subscription to channels and posting messages to channels
* Bulk actions - Delete the keys in bulk based on the filters set in Browser or Tree view
* Workbench - advanced command line interface with intelligent command auto-complete, complex data visualizations and support for the raw mode
* Command auto-complete support for [RediSearch](https://oss.redis.com/redisearch/), [RedisJSON](https://oss.redis.com/redisjson/), [RedisGraph](https://oss.redis.com/redisgraph/), [RedisTimeSeries](https://oss.redis.com/redistimeseries/), [RedisAI](https://oss.redis.com/redisai/)
* Visualizations of your [RediSearch](https://oss.redis.com/redisearch/) index, queries, and aggregations. Ability to build [your own data visualization plugins](https://github.com/RedisInsight/Packages)

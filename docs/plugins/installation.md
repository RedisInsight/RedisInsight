# Plugin installation & Usage

This document describes the guides to add `plugins` for the Workbench to Redis Insight.

## Installation guide

**Note**: While adding new plugins for Workbench, use files only from trusted
authors to avoid automatic execution of malicious code.

1. Download the plugin for the Workbench.
2. Open the `plugins` folder with the following path
   - For MacOs: `<usersHomeDir>/.redis-insight/plugins`
   - For Windows: `C:/Users/{Username}/.redis-insight/plugins`
   - For Linux: `<usersHomeDir>/.redis-insight/plugins`
3. Add the folder with plugin to the `plugins` folder

To see the uploaded plugin visualizations in the command results, reload the Workbench
page and run Redis command relevant for this visualization.

Below you can find a guide to see command results in the uploaded plugin visualization:

1. Open Redis Insight
2. Open a database added
3. Open the Workbench
4. Run the Redis command relevant for the plugin visualization

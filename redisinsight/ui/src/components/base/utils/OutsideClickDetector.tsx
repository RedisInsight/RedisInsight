// the closest common ancestor of the press (mousedown, touchstart)
// and release (mouseup, touchend) events (often <body />) if
// the the target of each event differs.
// We need the actual event targets to make the correct decisions
// about user intention. So, consider the down/start and up/end
// items below as the deconstruction of a click event.

  // Taking this approach instead of checking if the event's
  // target element exists in this component's DOM subtree is
  // necessary for handling clicks originating from children
  // rendered through React's portals (EuiPortal). The id tracking
  // works because React guarantees the event bubbles through the
  // virtual DOM and executes EuiClickDetector's onClick handler,
  // stamping the id even though the event originates outside
  // this component's reified DOM tree.

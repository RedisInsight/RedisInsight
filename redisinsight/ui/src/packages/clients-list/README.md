[Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) is used to build the plugin.

## Running locally

_Note_: Base styles are included to `index.html` 
from [RedisInsight](https://github.com/RedisInsight/RedisInsight) repository.

This command will generate the `vendor` folder with styles and fonts of the core app. Add this folder 
inside the folder for your plugin and include appropriate styles to the `index.html` file.

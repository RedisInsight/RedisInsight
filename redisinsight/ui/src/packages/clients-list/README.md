[Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) is used to build the plugin.

## Running locally

The following commands will install dependencies and start the server to run the plugin locally:

_Note_: Base styles are included to `index.html`
from [RedisInsight](https://github.com/RedisInsight/RedisInsight) repository.

This command will generate the `vendor` folder with styles and fonts of the core app. Add this folder
inside the folder for your plugin and include appropriate styles to the `index.html` file.

# RedisInsight Playwright Tests

This project contains end-to-end tests for RedisInsight using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/). It supports running tests against three different RedisInsight builds:

- **Docker Build**
- **Electron Build**
- **Local Web Build** (built directly from the source code)

---

## Installation

> _Note: All commands below should be run from the `tests/playwright` directory._

Before running any tests, make sure you have the dependencies installed:

1. Install Node dependencies:

   ```shell
   yarn install
   ```

2. Install Playwright browsers:

   ```shell
   yarn playwright install
   ```

3. Install Playwright OS dependencies (Linux only):

   ```shell
   sudo yarn playwright install-deps
   ```

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed and running.
- Redis test environment and RedisInsight configurations from the `tests/e2e` project.

## Environment-Specific Setup and Test Execution

For more details, refer to the [Playwright documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/running-tests).

### Start Redis Test Environment (Required for All Builds)

Navigate to the `tests/e2e` directory and run:

```shell
docker compose -p test-docker -f rte.docker-compose.yml up --force-recreate --detach
```

### Docker Build

- Build the Docker image locally or trigger a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/RedisInsight/RedisInsight/actions/workflows/manual-build.yml) to build and download the artifact (`docker-linux-alpine.amd64.tar`).
- Load the image:
  ```shell
  docker load -i docker-linux-alpine.amd64.tar
  ```
- Ensure the following environment variables are set in `tests/e2e/.env`:
  - `RI_ENCRYPTION_KEY`
  - `RI_SERVER_TLS_CERT`
  - `RI_SERVER_TLS_KEY`
- Navigate to the `tests/e2e` directory and start the container:
  ```shell
  docker compose -p e2e-ri-docker -f docker.web.docker-compose.yml up --detach --force-recreate
  ```
- Validate app is running at: `https://localhost:5540`.

#### Run Playwright Tests

_Note: Make sure to run the commands bellow from the `e2e/playwright` directory._

Run all tests:

```shell
yarn test:chromium:docker
```

Run in debug mode:

```shell
yarn test:chromium:docker:debug
```

Run a specific spec file:

```shell
yarn test:chromium:docker basic-navigation
```

---

### Electron Build

- Build the project from the root directory:
  ```shell
  yarn package:prod
  ```
- Update `ELECTRON_EXECUTABLE_PATH` in `tests/playwright/env/.desktop.env` to point to the generated executable file (MacOS by default).

#### Run Playwright Tests

_Note: Make sure to run the commands bellow from the `e2e/playwright` directory._

```shell
yarn test:electron
```

---

### Local Web Build

- Make sure you don't have anything (docker container, local server, etc.) running on port 5540.
- Start the UI and API servers:
  ```shell
  yarn dev:ui
  yarn dev:api
  ```
- Access the app at: `http://localhost:8080`.

#### Run Playwright Tests

_Note: Make sure to run the command bellow from the `e2e/playwright` directory._

```shell
yarn test:chromium:local-web
```

## Folder structure

- `/env` - contains env configs for the 3 types of builds.
- `/tests` - Contains the actual tests.
- `/helpers/api` - ported some api helpers from the tests/e2e project. They are used for setting up data.
- `/pageObjects` - ported page element locators and logic from the tests/e2e project.

## Extra Tooling

### Auto-Generate Tests

Use Playwright's Codegen to auto-generate tests:

```shell
yarn playwright codegen
```

### Interactive UI Mode

Start Playwright's interactive UI mode:

```shell
yarn playwright test --ui
```

## Reports

### Allure Reports

- Ensure `JAVA_HOME` is set and JDK version 8 to 11 is installed.
- Generate a report with history:
  ```shell
  yarn test:allureHistoryReport
  ```
- For more details, refer to the [Allure documentation](https://allurereport.org/docs/playwright-reference/).

### Execution Time Comparison

| Test Name                         | Framework  | Browser  | Duration |
| --------------------------------- | ---------- | -------- | -------- |
| Verify that user can add Hash Key | TestCafe   | Chromium | 27s      |
| Verify that user can add Hash Key | Playwright | Chromium | 10s      |
| Verify that user can add Hash Key | TestCafe   | Electron | 30s      |
| Verify that user can add Hash Key | Playwright | Electron | 18s      |

## Code Coverage

### Overview

The Playwright tests can collect code coverage for the React frontend application. This helps track which parts of the UI code are being exercised by the end-to-end tests.

### Quick Start

# Start the UI with instrumentation for collecting code coverage

Ensure UI app is running with `COLLECT_COVERAGE=true` env variable, or simply run the following helper from the root folder

```shell
yarn dev:ui:coverage
```

# Run tests with coverage and generate both text and HTML reports

```shell
cd tests/playwright
yarn test:coverage
```

### Coverage Reports Location

After running coverage tests, reports are generated in:

- **HTML Report**: `tests/playwright/coverage/index.html` - Interactive, browsable coverage report
- **LCOV Report**: `tests/playwright/coverage/lcov.info` - For CI/CD integration
